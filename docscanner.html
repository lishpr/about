                Taking a photo of a document is way easier than scanning it. <br>
                However, it's almost impossible to hold your arms straight enough so that the quality of your photo could match that of a scan. <br>
                The good news is, there are several apps available to improve the quality of your photo. <br>
                And this project is try to decompose the scanner apps and create my own version of it! <br>

        The project is completed in three steps. <br>
        1. Recognize the corners of the document; <br>
        2. Rectify the document with affine transformation so that it's no longer tilted; <br>
        3. Make it nice looking!

    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        We humans could most of the times recognize the edges or corners of objects. 
        What we perceive as "edges" are gaps in contiguity in what we see. <br>
        For example, consider we have a brown desk and a white wall. 
        Then, the gap from brown to white could be recognized by us humans as edges. <br>
        Simulating this attribute of edge detection in human eyes, we could make computers "see" edges.

    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        We could take the finite difference, or gradient of the image. 
        Where the color in the image is "smooth", the gradient is small.
        Similarly, where the color in the image changes, the gradient is big. <br>
        Below is one example of this attribute. 
        On the left is the visualization of the gradient of the image of the library on the right. <br>
        The edges of the library have already popped out.

        But this is not good enough. 
        Many minor gaps in color, which are not edges, are also recorded by taking the gradient.
        Therefore, we need to keep the biggest gradient value in a region, and ignore the rest, 
        to make sure that what we are actually not recording gaps that are not edges. <br>
        This process is called Non-Maximum Supression. Code for which is shown below.
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-light"><code>
        def nms(g_mag, ws=5):
            copy = g_mag.copy()
            check = np.zeros(g_mag.shape)
            for i in range(0, g_mag.shape[0] - ws, ws):
                for j in range(0, g_mag.shape[1] - ws, ws):
                window = copy[i : i + ws, j : j + ws]
                ind = np.where(window == window.max())
                check[i + ind[0][0], j + ind[1][0]] = g_mag[i + ind[0][0], j + ind[1][0]]
            return check

        // g_mag is the magnitude of the gradient shown in the visualization.
        // ws is the window size of the region where NMS is performed.
    </code></pre>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        After we have defined edges to be "changes in values of color", we could expand it to define corners. <br>
        Corners are places where have a large change in color intensity in any direction. <br>
        After nailing the definition of corners, we may find that in contrast to flat regions or edge regions,
        the gradient is large in two linearly independent directions. <br>
        A smart algorithm for finding such region is called the Shi-Tomasi Detector, which is a kind of PCA.
        The pseudocode for which is shown below
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-light"><code>
        def cornerdetection:
            Filter image with Gaussian Filter
            Compute the gradient of the image
            Move window over image, for each window:
                Find the matrix for this window
                Find the eigenvalues of this matrix
                if the two eigenvalues are both large, corner detected:
                    let e(x,y) be the smaller of the eigenvalues
                    (x,y) is a corner if it's the local maximum and larger than a set threshold*
        
        // the threshold is set empirically.

        Now we have the ability to extract corners from an image, we could apply the ability to a real document,
        extracting the corners of that document.
        And what we want to accomplish in this step is shown below, rectify what's on the left 
        to the good-looking rectified document on the right.

        After obtaining the corners of the document, 
        the intuitive way of rectifying the image would be 
        "matching" the corners of the document to a rectangle. <br>
        And that's basically what we do.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        Through a trick called "affine transformation", where we manipulate the image in 3-D,
        we could transform the image into any shape. The transformation matrix could be obtained
        through the following program, given the corners of the source shape and the corners of the target shape.
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-light"><code>
        def computeH(source_pts, target_pts):
            H = np.zeros((3, 3))

            A = source_pts[:,:3]
            x4 = source_pts[:,3]
            l = np.linalg.inv(A) @ x4
            Ha = A @ np.diag(l)

            B = target_pts[:,:3]
            y4 = target_pts[:,3]
            m = np.linalg.inv(B) @ y4
            Hb = B @ np.diag(m)

            H = Hb @ np.linalg.inv(Ha)
            return H

        Up until now, our camera based scanner already looks pretty convincing. 
        In the next step, we are going to solve some final issues.
