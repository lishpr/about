                Programming could seem like magic for beginners. You type in lines of code, then things just happen. <br>
                Learning CS is the process of demystifying the magic, 
                and gain a better understanding of those tools that have so rapidly changed our lives. <br>
                Through creating my own compiler and the course in general, 
                I understood how programming languages function and how they work in various settings.

    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        We humans could most of the times recognize the edges or corners of objects. 
        What we perceive as "edges" are gaps in contiguity in what we see. <br>
        For example, consider we have a brown desk and a white wall. 
        Then, the gap from brown to white could be recognized by us humans as edges. <br>
        Simulating this attribute of edge detection in human eyes, we could make computers "see" edges.

        We could take the finite difference, or gradient of the image. 
        Where the color in the image is "smooth", the gradient is small.
        Similarly, where the color in the image changes, the gradient is big. <br>
        Below is one example of this attribute. 
        On the right is the visualization of the gradient of the image of the library on the left. <br>
        The edges of the library have already popped out.

        But this is not good enough. 
        Many minor gaps in color, which are not edges, are also recorded by taking the gradient.
        Therefore, we need to keep the biggest gradient value in a region, and ignore the rest, 
        to make sure that what we are actually not recording gaps that are not edges. <br>
        This process is called Non-Maximum Supression. Code for which is shown below.

                check = np.zeros(g_mag.shape)
                for i in range(0, g_mag.shape[0] - ws, ws):

                return check

            // g_mag is the magnitude of the gradient shown in the visualization.
            // ws is the window size of the region where NMS is performed.

        After we have defined edges to be "changes in values of color", we could expand it to define corners. <br>
        Corners are places where have a large change in color intensity in any direction. <br>
        After nailing the definition of corners, we may find that in contrast to flat regions or edge regions,
        the gradient is large in two linearly independent directions. <br>
        A smart algorithm for finding such region is called the Shi-Tomasi Detector, which is a kind of PCA.
        The pseudocode for which is shown below

            def cornerdetection:

                Compute the gradient of the image
                Move window over image, for each window:
                    Find the matrix for this window
                    Find the eigenvalues of this matrix
                    if the two eigenvalues are both large, corner detected:
                        let e(x,y) be the smaller of the eigenvalues
                        (x,y) is a corner if it's the local maximum and larger than a set threshold*
            
            // the threshold is set empirically.
