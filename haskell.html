                Programming could seem like magic for beginners. You type in lines of code, then things just happen. <br>
                Learning CS is the process of demystifying the magic, 
                and gain a better understanding of those tools that have so rapidly changed our lives. <br>
                Through creating my own compiler and the course in general, 
                I understood how programming languages function and how they work in various settings.

        This compiler is done in three parts. 
    </p>
    <li class="card-text" id="contents">
        First, the lexing and parsing part, 
        which is the part that given any code, 
        dissolves them into values through lexing, 
        then assemble the values into tokens through parsing. 
    </li>
    <li class="card-text" id="contents">
        Second, the evaluation part,
        which is the part that does the arithmetic computation when given tokens.
    </li>
    <li class="card-text" id="contents">
        Last, the REPL part,
        which is a shell that does reading, evaluation, printing, then <em>loop</em>!
        So that you could enter commands into the shell that utilizes the first two parts to offer solutions.
    </li>
    <br>
        

    <h4 class="icons" id="courses">Part 1: Lexing and Parsing</h4>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        First, we have some tokens in mind that represents many values or grammatical functions, such as
        <code>TRUE</code>, <code>FALSE</code>, <code>+</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>let ... in</code>, etc.
        Then we should determine the kind of code that we should interpret into those tokens.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        For example, when we encounter a typed <code>TRUE</code> in the code, 
        we want to interpret this to the <code>TRUE</code> token. Similarly, 
        we could interpret <code>+</code> into a <code>Plus</code> token.<br>
    </p>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        Those are relatively simple. However, when in <code>let ... in</code> statements, 
        or <code>if ... then ... else</code> statements,
        we need to interpret the skeleton of those statements into their respective tokens,
        and everything else into some other tokens. <br>
        This is done by pattern matching, which instructs the parser that, 
        when a pattern such as <code>let ... in</code> is seen, dissolve them into one <code>let</code> token
        and a variable assignment token. For example, in the following example, when some programmer codes something like below,
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-light"><code>
        let foo = \\x -> if y then z else w in foo
    </code></pre>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        the lexer and parser return some constructed tokens as the following
    </p>
    <pre class="bg-light"><code>
        ELet "foo" (ELam "x" (EIf (EVar "y") (EVar "z") (EVar "w"))) (EVar "foo")
    </code></pre>

    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        As we have the ability to lex and parse what we code into tokens,
        we may go further into manipulating the tokens.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4 class="icons" id="courses">Part 2: Evaluation</h4>
    
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        Now that we have a lot of tokens, for example,
        we could have <code>1 + 2</code> - lexed and parsed -> <code>EBin Plus (EInt "1") (EInt "2")</code>.
        The problem thus became, how do we obtain <code>3</code> (or <code>EInt "3"</code>) from the tokens?
    </p>

    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        We could try define that, if ever <code>Plus</code> is encountered, 
        add the two integers associated with the <code>Plus</code>. And that does work for now.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        However, what if we have another <code>EBin</code> as one of the operands like in <code>1 + 3 * 4</code> 
        which would be parsed into <code>EBin Plus (EInt "1") (EBin Mul (EInt "3") (EInt "4"))</code>?
    </p>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        The "two integers" approach couldn't handle another <code>EBin</code>.
        And this should be solved by defining it <em>recursively</em>. <br>
        When we have two operands as integers, we could evaluate it right away.
        When either of the two operands is a <code>EBin</code>, we do another round of evaluation.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        So far, this is working properly. With just one glitch to be taken care of, which is the order of operation.
        We could add a line in the parser to make the priority of multiplication higher than plus and minus. 
        And that's basically it.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h4 class="icons" id="courses">Part 3: Read-Eval-Print Loop</h4>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        In the previous two parts, we have completed a working languages that does arithmetic calculations.
        But we have yet got an interface that could have the user to use the language.
        So in this part, we are going to write a shell that could: <br>
        1. Do some basic arithmetic calulations. <br>
        2. Allow you to define variables. <br>
        3. Allow some basic I/O operations. <br>
        4. Have a counter that indicates the number of commands have been executed.

            sub = 
                let sub1 x y = add x (0 - y) in
                    sub1

            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        It is worth noting that the implementation of <code>:load</code> involves
        keeping an environment of variables that could be referenced by later commands.
    </p>
    <p class="card-text" id="contents">
        And this concludes my compiler design.
